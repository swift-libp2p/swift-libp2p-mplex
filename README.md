## Overview
Mplex is a Stream Multiplexer protocol. The origins of this protocol are based in multiplex, the JavaScript-only Stream Multiplexer.

Mplex is a very simple protocol that does not provide many features offered by other stream multiplexers. Notably, mplex does not provide backpressure at the protocol level.

#### Note:
- For more information check out the [MPLEX Spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/mplex/README.md)
